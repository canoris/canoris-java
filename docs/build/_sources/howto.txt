Simple files howto
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This is a simple walkthrough demonstrating how to:

:ref:`upload_file`

:ref:`retrieve_all_files`

2) Retrieve a file.

3) Retrieve all files.

4) Retrieve a conversion.



First we need to create a CanorisResourceManager object. This object performs all communication with the
Canoris API. 

::

  CanorisResourceManager manager = new CanorisResourceManager();

.. _upload_file:

1) Upload a file
----------------

To upload a file simply do:

::

  CanorisFile file = (CanorisFile) manager.createFile(filePath, null)

*filePath*: the path where the file is located.
For the moment you can ignore the second parameter since it is not used.

This call will return a CanFile object, you will have to cast it since the method returns a CanorisResource object.
Refer to ADD_LINK_TO_JAVADOC for the structure of the CanorisFile object.

.. _retrieve_all_files:

3) Retrieve all files
---------------------

To get the files we simply do:

``Page pager = manager.getFiles();``

The pager object can be used to access the files and navigate to other pages (if any).
